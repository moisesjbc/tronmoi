Tronmoi is a Tron clone for two players (no machine player). It was made back in 2009, and by the end of 2014, I decided to refine it and release it as a demo (v0.1.0)

## Current status

**Inactive**. A playable demo (DEB package) can be downloaded (from here)[https://github.com/moisesjbc/tronmoi/releases].
